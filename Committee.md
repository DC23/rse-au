# RSE AU Interim Steering Committee

The interim steering committee is a group of RSEs and RSE-like people who
are interested in establishing an Australian chapter of Research Software Engineers.

We hope that within the first 6 to 12 months that we will have a community 
with a transparently elected Steering Committee.

## Committee Members

If you'd like to add more information to this list, please submit a PR.
