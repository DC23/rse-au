Nick Golding and Lance Wilson met to plan a face to face meetup of RSEs in Victoria.

We agreed to hold the event in the first half of August, with possible dates being 8th, 9th, 15th or 16th (Wednesdays and Thursdays). The event would be between 3pm and 5pm.

The event will include an introduction of what the RSE organisation looks like in the UK and why we need one in Australia.
We would also like to arrange for people who self-identify as RSEs (or similar) from a diversity of backgrounds, disciplines and career stages to talk about their experiences and need to an RSE career path.
This would be followed by structured discussions.

Next steps are to identify a venue central to Melbourne with good access and space for 30-50 attendees.
NG will look into venues at the University of Melbourne.

To find speakers and attendees from different backagrounds, and to advertise as broadly as possible, we will try to come up with a list of potential RSE contacts in Victoria.
NG has set up an editable Google doc, hosted on the group slack, with names of people we could contact or invite.
The link is deliberately not posted here as it contains names and email addresses of people who are not aware of the document.
Suggestions of people to add to that document would be very welcome!

Once the venue has been booked, we will set up a a meetup and start inviting people
