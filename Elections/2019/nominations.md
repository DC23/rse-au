### Diversity Statement

Diversity covers a broad range of categories, not just the protected attributes of gender, age, ethnicity, etc. As a 'Certified Professional Member' of the Australian Computer Society, I will add the experience of a software engineer — practicing in the research domain — to the diverse perspectives that this association aims to represent.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

Over the last 30 years, I have worked in various software engineering roles and industries. However, the last 12 years have been spent applying this experience to the research domain. I have gained an understanding of the aspects of software engineering that are relevant and useful within the research lifecycle from being embedded in a research group and from collaborating with researchers in a diverse range of fields. In addition, I have regularly published papers and presented on software architecture, eResearch, and research software engineering at national and international conferences and forums.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

As a steering committee member, I will bring a high-level perspective that will enable the committee to develop a strategy for growing the RSE community. In addition, through collaboration and communication, I can help the committee to stay focused on delivery, not just discussion. And finally, my excellent minuting skills will never go to waste.


*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I would like the association to have a greater recognition for the breadth of the RSE community in Australia: it's not just 'researchers who code'. In addition, I'd like the committee to fully exploit the goodwill we have built up with national and international organizations, so that we can promote the establishment of regional and local RSE groups. And finally, I'd like to see the committee move towards a formally established organization by the end of 2020.


*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

As a member of the interim steering committee, I have co-convened workshops, BoF sessions, and a mini-conference for the RSE-AUNZ at several national conferences. In addition, I have co-authored and presented the Australian version of the International RSE Survey. I have represented RSE-AUNZ and co-chaired the RSE Worldwide session at the UK's RSE Conference. And have taken a leading role to drive forward the development of the association's 'Goals and Deliverables 2019' and 'Election Process 2019'.

### Diversity Statement

I am a strong advocate of the finding that diverse teams are better performing teams.  This flows into my ongoing recruitment tasks, where I have assembled high-performing teams comprised of people from a range of backgrounds, ethnicities and a balance of genders. My current team at CSIRO is a perfect example!

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*

I have a BSc in Computer Science, Master of Information Technology and Grad Dip in Biotechnology & Business.

I have worked as a software developer at Monash University and the Bureau of Meteorology. I am currently leading the Data Analytics and Visualisation Team of eight developers in CSIRO’s Scientific Computing Group.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*

During my career, I have occupied many IT based roles in the research support area. These include Senior IT Officer, Divisional IT Manager, Executive Officer, and RSE Team Lead. This experience – including software design and implementation, IT infrastructure support, team management and project management - provides me with a great perspective on the issues affecting individuals across the “RSE spectrum”.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*

I’m really keen to see the RSE movement achieve recognition and acceptance in Australia, and for us to contribute to the movement internationally.

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*

I have successfully presented abstracts at eResearch Australasia and C3DIS – on Scientific Visualisation and the delivery of eResearch services. My latest co-authored submission to eResearch Australasia is accessible [here](https://conference.eresearch.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019_eResearch_24_Brief-Review-of-eResearch-Service-Provision-in-CSIRO-2019.pdf).

### Diversity Statement

I am a firm believer in the value of diverse teams. A wide range of backgrounds enhances both the team and the organisation to which it belongs. My commitment to diversity is reflected in the software engineering teams I have helped build. For example, a team that I formed in 2010 was dubbed "the United Nations" by team members due to the wide range of nationalities represented. The team was also diverse in both gender and religion. This team achieved great results under tremendous pressure, and the differing perspectives of team members contributed a lot to the outcomes. Currently I am supervising a female indigenous cadet whose cadetship is due to end before the end of her studies. I am working with both her and management to find a way to continue supporting her studies beyond the offical end of the cadetship term.

### Relevant Experience

*In 100 words, describe your experience of working as a Research Software Engineer.*
I hold a Bachelor of Computer Science with a major in psychology, and have worked as a professional software engineer since 2000. In 2010 I joined CSIRO where I worked on a wide range of research projects to the present day. From 2010 to late 2012 I was team lead of a diverse team building web applications for the biosecurity sector. I then moved to the Advanced Scientific Computing group where I have remained to the present day, first as software engineer, and since 2018 as team lead of the Research Software Engineering team. This has given me the opportunity to work on a range of scientific projects in many domains. From this experience I have developed the strong belief that the best outcomes in computational research can be achieved through an equal partnership between software engineers and scientists.

*What skills will you bring to the committee?*
I have a deep experience of the challenges facing professional software engineers working in research, both first-hand and through supporting my colleagues and staff. From this experience comes a firm commitment to furthering the agenda of the Research Software Engineering community. Additionally, I have studied and practiced both project management and change management in the last 10 years. My project management expertise will be valuable in coordinating RSE Commitee activities and projects, while my change management expertise brings a perspective that may be vital to the aspects of the commitees mission that require bringing about effective change. Finally, I also have experience in teaching fundamental software engineering skills and programming to researchers through conference workshops, webinars, and the CSIRO Digital Academy.

*What would you like to change through your involvement on the committee?*
Despite some improvements, adequate recognition of the contributions of software engineers to research outcomes remains a challenge. Some science domains and research groups do better than others. I believe that the RSE community can play a valuable role by developing and promoting guidelines and practices that ensure that RSEs gain consistent recognition commensurate with their contribution to research outcomes. This is an area that I would like to actively develop.

Secondly, I think that education is important. As a professional software engineer working in tandem with domain scientists, I have for many years seen the problems caused by the lack of some fundamental software engineering skills among researchers who code. I believe that the RSE community can play a role in defining the competencies that make up the RSE toolbox. These competencies can then inform training programs and movements such as the Software and Data Carpentries.

Finally, I want to see the RSE community grow and thrive both locally and internationally. My reaction when first reading of the RSE movement was "Yes! finally a description of what I have been doing for years."

*If you have already contributed to the RSE community, please list those contributions below.*
I have not formally contributed to the RSE community in the past, and this is exactly why I am applying. I feel a strong connection with the RSE community so it's time to put in some work. Having said that, many of my activities are relevant. For example, I have taught Python programming workshops focused on scientific applications for several years at the C3DIS conference. I have also taught Python programming through webinars as well as developing and teaching software carpentry material on Python programming for the CSIRO Data School. All of these activities have been fueled by my love of software engineering and my desire to help raise the standard of software engineering practices among researchers.
